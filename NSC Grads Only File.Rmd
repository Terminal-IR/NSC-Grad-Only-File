## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Set your working directory and parameters in the next chunk:

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#Libraries

setwd("Y:/RProjects/NSC Graduates Only File")
getwd()

```

## Program Specifics
This R Markdown document will:
  1) Connect to the EnrollmentMgmt database.
  2) Pull data necessary for the NSC Graduates Only File
  3) Create and save an Excel file - **Graduates Only File**
  
Once this process completes, there are steps that must be done for data clean-up and column formatting in the Excel file before submission. Please see https://theclearinghouse.download/erguide for file specifications. **This R-Markdown document was designed to comply with version 3.7 April 2024 of the Enrollment Reporting Programming and Testing Guide.**

## Excel File Clean-up
The file produced should look similar to this:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Sample_Excel_1.JPG")
```

The header row names include the appropriate column name in the title.  For example STU_FIRST_NAME_C belongs in column C. 

There are several columns that will need to be **deleted** before submission. These columns have "Not_Submitted" in the column names. They are included in the original file for trouble shooting and readability purposes.

The NSC file specs only allow for 6 programs to be reported in a file. The columns that relate to programs beyond 6 will need to be deleted before submitting the file. It is recommended that using the filter tool in Excel, filter column **NSC_CIP_AW_7** to show non-blanks and cut and paste the row results from all columns into a second **workbook**. Then delete the **columns** that pertain to programs 7 and beyond. All these columns are labeled _7, _8, _9,  etc.

The pivoted Academic Program specific columns are not automatically put in order. You will need to manual cut and paste columns in the file spec order. However all columns are labeled to make this task easier and less error prone. Note that columns **Privacy_Block_DE** through **Filler_DK** will need to be shifted to column DE through DK they are initially stored starting in column AW before the academic program data.

Any commas in the file need to be deleted as they will break the upload process. Search and delete/replace.

Check addresses for easy fixes like zip codes being reported in Address_Line_2.

Delete rows of students who do not have SSN's

## Gainful Employment FVT Graduate Reconciliation File (GRF)
The GE-FVT Grad Reconciliation File (GRF) may have too many SSN's to include in the SQL code for this program. This is the case for Butte's file. The workaround we used was to run the SQL code without limiting the SSNs.  Prior to submission, we used a VLOOKUP function in Excel to compare the returned SSNs in the Graduates Only File to the GRF. Student rows for SSN's not included in the GRF were deleted in the Graduates Only File  


## Ready for Submission
Once the Excel file is clean, remove the column name header row. Create a Header row and Trailer row as specified in the NSC guide. Save the file as a tab separated .txt file give it the name appropriate for submission.  For Butte College this is 00807300.txt Once the file is saved, change the file extension in widows explorer to .CLR The file is now ready for submission via the NSC's FTP process. 

# Code
## Opens a DB Connection
```{r echo=TRUE}

openDBConnection <- function() {
  db <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), .connection_string = "Driver={SQL Server};
        server=bearhouse.briarpatch.bcc;\ndatabase=EnrollmentMgmt;\ntrusted_connection=true", timeout = 10)
  return(db)
}

db <- openDBConnection()
```
